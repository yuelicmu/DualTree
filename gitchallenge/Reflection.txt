Refections:

GIT is a powerful tool for version control which is of vital importance in large-scale and collaborative work. It is not very friendly for beginners, but after some practice much more convenient to use. In this GIT challenge, through the nine-step exploration, I am able to use most basic functions in GIT. There are some points that I think should be noted while using:

1, in each time of commit, write simple and clear comments about the updates;

2, check the GIT status and stage useful changes from time to time;

3, remember to commit the changes after a stage of work;

4, before each merging be clear what are the differences between the two versions and take care of the differences;

5, remember to return to the correct branch before making changes.

I think GIT itself is not hard to manage after some practice, and the most important part in using GIT is to develop good coding habits. 

The most confusing part of GIT maybe the merge function in it. If we made many small changes in a file and then try to merge, then there will be many conflicts and we have to fix them manually, which would be not so efficient. Thus to use the merge function, we should make the programs more modularized and separate the functional parts and functions more clearly.

Some notes in programming:
add -b when checking out could create a new branch
add -m when commit and input comments directly(there is some problem with the text editor so better do this)
